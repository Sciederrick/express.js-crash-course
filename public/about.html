    <h1>What is One Health Companion?</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Frontline workers in human, animal, crop, and environmental health (community health workers, animal health assistants, agricultural extension workers, environmental health officers, wildlife officers etc.) work within the scope of their practice to identify health challenges at the community level and institute interventions. Many of these challenges are “wicked problems” occurring at the human_animal_environment interface, thus requiring an integrated, holistic approach (1). Despite this, there remains a huge gap in information exchange, limiting the multidisciplinary approach, especially in disease surveillance. This gap is costly and may translate into poor or suboptimal health outcomes. Most existing digital solutions are fragmented for different professionals. Projects like ZooLinK continue to demonstrate the value of integrated information systems across the human and animal health sectors. Solutions that bridge this gap are especially useful in low resource settings like Sub-Saharan Africa.

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          i. Enable real time tracking of community-specific One Health challenges at the human_animal_environment interface
        </li>
        <li>
          ii. Enable community frontline workers to exchange information and collaborate with key actors involved in the population’s health to address the root causes of the problem effectively.
        </li>
      </ul>
